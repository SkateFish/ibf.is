      "The greatest contribution of Mandalapruder or Vira Mandalaver is Sudamani Nigandhu. This work, which he created at the suggestion of his guru Gunapattiren, comprises 989 stanzas arranged in 12 chapters. It treats of the synonyms of the Flindu Deities, and of the objects of the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms as well as of the homonymous and generic terms. Mandalapuruder follows the style of Amarakosha in this regard. Mandalapuruder is also the author of a poem in praise of Arha, a divinity worshipped by Jains.",

    text: "In statistical quality control, the EWMA chart (or exponentially weighted moving average chart) is a type of control chart used to monitor either variables or attributes-type data using the monitored business or industrial process's entire history of output.[1] While other control charts treat rational subgroups of samples individually, the EWMA chart tracks the exponentially-weighted moving average of all prior sample means. EWMA weights samples in geometrically decreasing order so that the most recent samples are weighted most highly while the most distant samples contribute very little.",
